### Database Schema
```sql
-- Players table
CREATE TABLE players (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
    name TEXT NOT NULL UNIQUE,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);

-- Games table  
CREATE TABLE games (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
    player1_id INTEGER,
    player2_id INTEGER,
    player1_score INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
    player2_score INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
    winner_id INTEGER,
    game_duration INTEGER,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    FOREIGN KEY (player1_id) REFERENCES players (id),
    FOREIGN KEY (player2_id) REFERENCES players (id),
    FOREIGN KEY (winner_id) REFERENCES players (id)
);
```
